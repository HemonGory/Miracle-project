# Project Title: Miracle Project Landing Page

## Description
The "Miracle Project Landing Page" is a simple web page hosted on an Nginx server on AWS. This project demonstrates setting up a Linux server, installing Nginx, deploying an HTML page, configuring SSL with Certbot, and making the page accessible securely via HTTPS. The landing page introduces the user and includes basic project information.
